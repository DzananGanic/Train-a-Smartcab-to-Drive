# Train-a-Smartcab-to-Drive
In this project I am applying Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to train a smartcab to drive through the grid world. The car has a goal to reach the destination within the deadline while obeying traffic lights and considering other cars which move through the world. In order to accomplish this, I am using Q-Learning algorithm.
