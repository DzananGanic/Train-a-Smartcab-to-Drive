# Train-a-Smartcab-to-Drive
In this project I am applying Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to train a smartcab to drive through the grid world. The car has a goal to reach the destination within the deadline while obeying traffic lights and considering other cars which move through the world. In order to accomplish this, I am using Q-Learning algorithm.

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- PyGame

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory smartcab/ (that contains the two project directories) and run one of the following commands:

`python smartcab/agent.py` or
`python -m smartcab.agent`
